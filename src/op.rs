/* transcoded CIGAR and index

Transcoded CIGAR is encoded in a run-length manner, as in the original CIGAR string.
Each chunk for the run-length compression is represented by an op, which is 8-bit unsigned.

Op consists of two bitfields: total chunk length (columns) on reference sequence (5bit),
and leading event(s) (3bit). The leading event is one of { insertion, deletion, mismatch }
and the remainder till the end of the chunk is filled with matches. That is, any a chunk
has one of the following composition:

1. insertion of arbitrary length, and trailing matches up to 30 bases.
2. deletion up to three bases, and trailing matches up to 30 - #deletions.
3. a mismatch, and trailing matches up to 29 bases.


The 3-bit leading is defined to hold the events above as the following:

* for insertion, place a marker (0b000) that there is inserted bases between the chunk
    and the previous chunk.
* for deletion, encode the number of deleted bases as 0b001 ~ 0b011 (1 to 3).
* for mismatch, encode a base on the query sequence as 0b100 (A) ~ 0b111 (T).


The transcoded CIGAR stream is indexed at reference-side positions at regular intervals.
The interval is defined as `BLOCK_PITCH`, which is 256 by default. Pointer to the op array
and the insertion sequence array for each block is stored in `Block`. Since block boundary
is not always aligned to chunk (op) boundary, an offset within chunk from the block
boundary is also stored in `op_skip` field.
